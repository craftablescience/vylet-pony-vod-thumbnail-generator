so<00:17:10.400><c> I</c><00:17:10.480><c> don't</c><00:17:10.640><c> really</c><00:17:10.839><c> know</c><00:17:11.160><c> why</c><00:17:11.400><c> if</c><00:17:11.520><c> anyone</c><00:17:11.799><c> has</c>

00:17:11.909 --> 00:17:11.919 align:start position:0%
so I don't really know why if anyone has
 

00:17:11.919 --> 00:17:13.829 align:start position:0%
so I don't really know why if anyone has
an<00:17:12.120><c> answer</c><00:17:12.640><c> for</c><00:17:12.919><c> us</c><00:17:13.079><c> to</c><00:17:13.319><c> why</c><00:17:13.439><c> that</c><00:17:13.559><c> might</c><00:17:13.720><c> be</c>

00:17:13.829 --> 00:17:13.839 align:start position:0%
an answer for us to why that might be
 

00:17:13.839 --> 00:17:16.270 align:start position:0%
an answer for us to why that might be
the<00:17:13.919><c> case</c><00:17:14.360><c> that'</c><00:17:14.520><c> be</c><00:17:14.679><c> great</c><00:17:15.039><c> but</c><00:17:15.959><c> you</c><00:17:16.079><c> know</c>

00:17:16.270 --> 00:17:16.280 align:start position:0%
the case that' be great but you know
 

00:17:16.280 --> 00:17:17.750 align:start position:0%
the case that' be great but you know
what<00:17:16.439><c> we</c><00:17:16.600><c> got</c><00:17:16.799><c> I</c><00:17:16.880><c> think</c><00:17:17.039><c> we've</c><00:17:17.240><c> got</c><00:17:17.319><c> it</c><00:17:17.439><c> figured</c>

00:17:17.750 --> 00:17:17.760 align:start position:0%
what we got I think we've got it figured
 

00:17:17.760 --> 00:17:19.870 align:start position:0%
what we got I think we've got it figured
out<00:17:18.600><c> maybe</c><00:17:18.799><c> we'll</c><00:17:18.959><c> have</c><00:17:19.079><c> some</c><00:17:19.240><c> hiccups</c><00:17:19.640><c> along</c>

00:17:19.870 --> 00:17:19.880 align:start position:0%
out maybe we'll have some hiccups along
 

00:17:19.880 --> 00:17:22.549 align:start position:0%
out maybe we'll have some hiccups along
the<00:17:20.000><c> way</c><00:17:20.280><c> still</c><00:17:20.760><c> but</c><00:17:21.559><c> I</c><00:17:21.720><c> tested</c><00:17:22.079><c> it</c><00:17:22.280><c> and</c><00:17:22.400><c> it's</c>

00:17:22.549 --> 00:17:22.559 align:start position:0%
the way still but I tested it and it's
 

00:17:22.559 --> 00:17:24.270 align:start position:0%
the way still but I tested it and it's
definitely<00:17:23.000><c> a</c><00:17:23.199><c> lot</c><00:17:23.480><c> better</c><00:17:23.919><c> than</c><00:17:24.079><c> the</c>

00:17:24.270 --> 00:17:24.280 align:start position:0%
definitely a lot better than the
 

00:17:24.280 --> 00:17:29.590 align:start position:0%
definitely a lot better than the
crossover<00:17:24.839><c> version</c><00:17:25.360><c> so</c><00:17:26.199><c> let's</c><00:17:26.439><c> go</c><00:17:26.600><c> to</c><00:17:26.760><c> run</c>
